# IM4717 Web Application Design: Case Study Part 4

To work on Case Study Part 4 (or your project) on your local machine, you will need a web server since PHP files need to be run on the server.

VirtualBox installer: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
`EEIM4717fresh_student.ova`: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12z4pL-TCWAnW_tPPaco04z5Pu0Z_rpfX/view?usp=sharing

Open VirtualBox, go to *File > Import Appliance* and select the `EEIM4717fresh_student.ova` file with default configurations. Double-click to start the server.

To open the project directory, hit `Win+R` and open `\\192.168.56.2\f31im`. *(Replace `f31im` with your own class index)*
